# OverflowAndroid

The polyfill for `overflow:scroll` / `overflow:auto` and `element.scrollLeft` / `element.scrollTop` on Android browser.

Android browser has problems as below:

- `overflow:scroll` and `overflow:auto` don't work on Android 2.x. The elements don't accept swipe operation.
- `element.scrollLeft` and `element.scrollTop` don't work on Android 4.0.x. The elements can't scroll via JavaScript. Strange to say, the element that is set `overflow:hidden` can scroll. But of course that element doesn't accept swipe operation.

OverflowAndroid solves above problems both.

**See <a href="http://anseki.github.io/overflow-android">DEMO</a>**

## Usage
[Hammer.js](http://hammerjs.github.io/) is required.

```html
<script src="hammer.min.js"></script>
<script src="overflow-android.min.js"></script>
```

```html
<!-- This `overflow:auto` isn't necessary. It works on desktop PC as native. -->
<div id="view" style="overflow: auto; width: 300px; height: 300px;">  <!-- Like an iframe window -->
  <div style="width: 900px; height: 600px;">                          <!-- Like an iframe document -->
    <img src="photo.jpg" width="900" height="600" alt="sample">
  </div>
</div>
```

```js
var element = document.getElementById('view');
new OverflowAndroid(element);
// Now, the element accepts swipe operation.

// And it can scroll via scrollLeft/scrollTop.
element.scrollLeft = 30;
```

## Constructor

```js
overflowA = new OverflowAndroid(viewElement)
```

The `OverflowAndroid` constructor accepts a element that is scrolling frame. It get first child element that includes contents and it moves when scrolling. The specified element like an `iframe` window, and the first child element like an `iframe` document.  
That has already finished. Now, the specified element accept swipe operation, and it can scroll via `scrollLeft`/`scrollTop`.  
And the instance that is returned by constructor has some methods. (see below)  
NOTE: The contents that is included in specified element other than first child element of it are ignored.

## Methods

### `scrollLeft`

```js
currentPosition = overflowA.scrollLeft([newPosition])
```

Return the number of pixels that the element's content is scrolled to the left. If an argument is given, the element scrolls to specified position and it is returned.  
This work equals `element.scrollLeft` property.

### `scrollTop`

```js
currentPosition = overflowA.scrollTop([newPosition])
```

Return the number of pixels that the element's content is scrolled upward. If an argument is given, the element scrolls to specified position and it is returned.  
This work equals `element.scrollTop` property.

### `initSize`

```js
overflowA.initSize()
```

OverflowAndroid computes the size of elements for scroll. It computes again when a window is resized.  
If you change the size of elements, you must call this method.

## Options

You can tune the behavior of OverflowAndroid via options below.

### `OverflowAndroid.enable`

As default, OverflowAndroid works only touch-device. You can control the working or not via specifying a boolean to this option.  
NOTE: This must be done before making an instance.

Example:

```js
// Android only
OverflowAndroid.enable = navigator.userAgent.indexOf('Android') > 0;
```

```js
// Anytime
OverflowAndroid.enable = true;
```

### `OverflowAndroid.fps`
This is frame rate for inertia scroll animation when swipe operation. This is a number of frames per second. `60` as default.

### `OverflowAndroid.friction`
This is strength of slowdown for inertia scroll animation when swipe operation. This is a number of pixels per milli second. `0.001` as default.
